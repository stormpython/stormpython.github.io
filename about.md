I am a former biologist/ecologist turned software developer.

I studied behavioral ecology in graduate school. Specifically, my
research focused on understanding how ants distinguish nestmates, ants residing in the same colony, from non-nestmates,
ants from different colonies. If you'd like to learn more, you can read a review of my research
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~dmgordon/articles/other/myrmecological-news-16/SturgisGordon2012.pdf">here<a/>. For
a more brief introduction to my graduate work, check out my very <a href="{{ site.url }}/nestmate-recognition">first blog post</a>.

After graduate school, I became an <a href="http://insightdatascience.com/">Insight Data Science</a> fellow.
Insight is a recruitment company focused on helping academics transition into the Data Science industry.
If you are interested in learning more about Insight, check out my <a href="{{ site.url }}/transitioning-to-industry-with-insight">blog post</a>.
After Insight, I worked as a data visualization engineer/data analyst for <a href="https://beatsmusic.com/">Beats Music</a>.
I am currently a data visualization engineer at <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.com/">Elasticsearch</a>.
