I am a former biologist/ecologist turned software developer. I studied behavioral ecology in graduate school. Specifically, my
research focused on understanding how ants distinguish nestmates, ants residing in the same colony, from non-nestmates,
ants from different colonies. If you'd like to learn more, you can read a review of my research <a href="">here<a/>. For
a more brief introduction to my graduate work, check out my very <a href="">first blog post</a>.

After graduate school, I became an <a href="">Insight Data Science</a> fellow. Insight is a recruitment company focused
on helping academics transition into the Data Science industry. If you are interested in learning more about Insight, I
have written a blog post about it and my experience <a href="">here</a>. After Insight, I worked as a data visualization
engineer/data analyst for <a href="">Beats Music</a>. I am currently a data visualization engineer at
<a href="">Elasticsearch</a>.

* Javascript (learning as much as I can about it)
* Gadgets (any and all gadgets)
* Science (specifically Animal Behavior)
* Sports (mainly basketball, football, and boxing, but I don't discriminate)
* Learning and teaching
