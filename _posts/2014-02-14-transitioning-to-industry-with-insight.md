As a biologist that transitioned from academia to the data science industry, I often get asked by biologist that are
aspiring data scientist, how I did it? The answer is that <a href="http://insightdatascience.com/">Insight Data Science</a> had a lot to do with it.
For those of you who have never heard about Insight, it is a 6-week fellowship program in which academics from many
different scientific disciplines are trained in the art of data science. But before I go into specifics, let me tell
you a little about my background and why making the transition from academia to industry was a monumental leap for me.

I have studied biology my entire life. In fact, the college I attended was specifically geared to biology and the
environmental sciences. Most courses outside of biology or science that I took as an undergrad were provided by a different
educational institution than my college. Even after college, I worked in a molecular lab studying fluorescent proteins
and at a pharmaceutical company purifying proteins for medicinal purposes. After 3 years of working, I decided to go to
grad school to earn a PhD in Behavioral Ecology. My research focused on <a href="{{ site.url }}/nestmate-recognition">nestmate recognition</a> in ants.
In all that time, I hadn't taken one computer science or programming course. I had only dabbled with Python and programmed in R,
an open source statistical programming language used by many poor undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students.

I didn't quite have the skill set of a data scientist. So what changed?

I won't bore you with the details of leaving academia and having to decide what I wanted to do with my life. At some point
in the final year of my PhD, I decided I really enjoyed analyzing and mining data. So, I was lucky when a friend sent me
a link to an application for Insight. I applied and got in, and looking back I am not sure why I was accepted. But I am
extremely grateful, because this is where my learning truly began.

While I was very familiar with statistics, experimental design, and data analysis, I lacked coding experience and basic
knowledge of the data science space, the tech space, algorithms, databases, basic computer science knowledge, etc.
I could go on, but I won't. Once I joined Insight, there was a mountain of
knowledge I needed to learn and at times it was overwhelming. You are given 4 weeks to complete a project in which you
create a data product that provides actionable insights. The rest of the time, you spend meeting amazing engineers,
entrepreneurs, and data scientists. Not to mention the amount of time you need to put in to study and prepare for interviews.
All while you are learning how to better code, build web applications, throw data into databases, query APIs, and implement
engineering best practices. Its quite a lot to take in, especially if you are like me and have limited experience in all
those areas.

So, how did I get through it? Well, there was no magic. I worked my butt off. Granted, I had a lot of help. Jake and the
great people at Insight were wonderful in helping me progress through the program and with helping me find a job afterwards.
I learned a lot from my Insight peers. Insight fellows are truly bright, innovative, and driven people. I certainly still
do not know everything, but 2 years out, I am in a much better place than I was before, and much of that initial push
had to do with my experience at Insight.

If you are a scientist, biologist, or academic interested in applying to Insight and want to know more about the process,
I have attached a list of questions I am commonly asked with my answers. Hopefully this helps answer your questions, but
if not, feel free to ask questions in the comments section.

<ol>
  <li>
<p>Did you need to show you had a lot of exposure to working with large data to get accepted? If you did, what did you highlight?</p>
<p>
  Having experience with large data sets is not a prerequisite. Having experience with data is. In fact, it is extremely
  uncommon for anyone in academia to deal with the amount of data you'd see in industry. The main thing to getting into Insight
  is to be able to show that you are passionate about data, learning, and data science. You need to be able to communicate
  what it is that you do very clearly so that a lay person can understand. And it doesn't hurt to show off projects you have
  done with data outside of your research.
</p>
</li>

  <li>
  <p>
What programming languages do you think are critical for either getting accepted, or completing the program?
  </p>
  <p>
  Going into Insight, I had experience mainly with R, but I also had some experience with Python.
  If you are not that comfortable with Python, use this time now to get comfortable. Start coding in Python.
  Familiarize yourself with their machine learning, statistical, math related libraries, etc. Do some projects in Python.
  Take time to get better at Python, trust me, you will need it. If not to get into Insight, to get a job after Insight.
  Coding is very important and it may very well become a cutoff in the future for getting into Insight. Other helpful
  languages include a SQL or NoSQL language, Javascript, HTML5, and CSS3. This is not a comprehensive list, you could
  easily add more, but these should get you started.
  </p>
  </li>

  <p>
Can you tell me a little about your data project during the program?
</p>
<p>
  The jist of my data project is listed on my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/shelby-sturgis/10/49b/a34">LinkedIn profile</a>. That is basically it. I can tell you about
  the process. First, you'll need to come up with a question that you'd like to answer or a problem you'd like to address,
  and choose whatever data (public or private) are available. You need to choose something that is actionable.
  That is, the answer you come up with can immediately be acted upon by the audience you are addressing. You use whatever
  tools at your disposal to accomplish the task and present it as a web app. If you do not have any experience with
  Javascript, HTML, CSS, MVC frameworks, start practicing. A website that is great for learning or brushing up on this stuff
  is <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>. You can even learn Python there. It is really nice and has a great interface for getting
  started with a language quickly. It will even teach you about APIs, etc. Stuff you should know before going to
  Insight or interviewing for a job in Data Science.
  </p>

  <p>
Finally, how was the post-program job search for you?
</p>
<p>
  Rough. I won't lie, interviewing is tough. You are constantly tested and no one cares that you have a PhD, Masters, etc.
  They just want to know if you can do whatever it is they need you to do with very little to no guidance. Many times,
  they may not even know what they are looking for or you are not sure what they want until the interview. You will
  have to study daily and cram like you would for exams. I had a lot of catching up to do since I have never taken a formal
  computer science course (not that that is a prerequisite). But you certainly need to know certain things depending on the
  path in data science you intend to choose.

**Good luck with Insight and your future job search!**
