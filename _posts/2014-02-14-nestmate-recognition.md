Happy Valentines Day everyone!

I want to start off my blog by discussing a topic close to my heart, **ants**!
As a graduate student, I studied ant communication. More specifically, my research involved understanding
how ants recognize one another. Now, you might be asking yourself, why would anyone want to get a PhD in ants.
Well, its quite simple really. Ants are extremely fascinating.

## Fun Ant Facts
* Ant colonies are composed of all female workers (males only exist for reproduction purposes and quickly die thereafter)
* The colony is not run by the queen
* Within colonies, there is division of labor
* Workers determine what needs to be done through interactions with other workers
* Some queens can live > 20+ years
* There are some species of ants that enslave workers of other species (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave-making_ant">slave-making ants</a>)
* There are ~22,000 species of ants
* Ants have colonized almost every landmass on Earth
* Ant colonies can range from a few dozen individuals to millions (just check out the video below!)

The list goes on! So, now that you know why ants are cool, let's dive into the topic of my research, nestmate recognition.

## Nestmate Recognition
Nestmate recognition is the ability of ants to distinguish nestmates, ants residing in the same colony, from non-nestmates,
ants from other colonies. Imagine you are a worker in a colony with 12 million ants. How would you tell the difference
between ants that belong in your colony (many ants of which you've never met) and those that do not belong?

Since ants have poor vision and because ants communicate chemically, these differences are defined by how ants smell.
Ants from the same colony tend to smell more alike than ants from different colonies. If an ant's odor is just beyond the
threshold for acceptance into the colony, it may be attacked or harassed by other ants. So, you'd simply
smell the other ant. If it is within the threshold for acceptance, you'd let them in, and if not, you'd battle to the death!

Simple, right? Well, not quite. But what is?

## A Case Study with the Red Harvester Ant, _Pogonomyrmex barbatus_

<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_harvester_ant">
Pogonomyrmex barbatus is a species of harvester ant from the genus Pogonomyrmex. Its common names include red ant and red harvester ant.[1] These large (5â€“7 millimeters) ants prefer arid chaparral habitats and are native to the southwest United States.[2] Nests are made underground (up to 2.5 meters deep) in exposed areas. Their diets consist primarily of seeds, and they consequently participate in myrmecochory, an ant-plant interaction through which the ants gain nutrients and the plants benefit through seed dispersal. Red harvester ants are often mistaken for fire ants, but are not closely related to any fire ant species, native or introduced.
</blockquote>

When I first set out to do my research, I was hoping to define what the threshold for recognition was for my particular
ant species, _P. barbatus_. In this way, I could alter how ants smell and watch them tear each other to shreads.
How cool would that be!

Unfortunately, I failed in that regard. However, what I discovered was immensely more interesting. At least in my opinion.

## Aggression is Task Dependent
As it turns out, in red harvester ants, the tendency for aggression has less to do with how another ant smells and more to do
with the work an ant performs. For example, if you are a patroller, an ant tasked with patrolling the territory,
you are likely to respond much more aggressively to an intruder on your property than an ant whose task it is to collect food.

Now, I know what you are thinking. That makes sense, some ants are born fighters and others are born foragers.
But what if I told you that ants switch task throughout their lives. At some point, a forager was a patroller. So what changes?
Why would an ant go from being aggressive to non-nestmates to almost indifferent? Well, the answer may lie in changes in
the neurophysiology of ants overtime and in the ecology of the system.
