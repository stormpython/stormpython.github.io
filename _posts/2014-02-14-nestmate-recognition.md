Happy Valentines Day everyone! I want to start off my on personal blog by discussing a topic close to my heart, **ants**!
I earned my PhD in Behavioral Ecology in 2012 from Stanford University. As a graduate student, I studied ant communication.
More specifically, my research involved understanding how ants recognize one another. Now, you might be asking yourself,
why would anyone want to get a PhD in ants. Well, its quite simple really. Ants are extremely fascinating.

Here are a few tidbits, you may not have known about these amazing creatures:

* Ant colonies are composed of all female workers (males only exist for reproduction purposes and quickly die thereafter)
* The colony is not run by the queen
* Workers determine what needs to be done through interactions with other workers
* Some queens can live > 20+ years
* There are some species of ants that enslave workers of other species (slave-making ants)
* There are ~22,000 species of ants
* Ants have colonized almost every landmass on Earth
* Ant colonies can range from a few dozen individuals to millions (just check out the video below!)
